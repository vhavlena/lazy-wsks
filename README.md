# Lazy Decision Procedure for WS2S

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vhavlena/lazy-wsks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vhavlena/lazy-wsks)

### Formula File Syntax

Input *ground* WS2S formula is specified according to the following syntax. It is a
subset of syntax MONA extended by additional atomic predicates.

```
file ::= (header;) (formula; | decl*)

header ::= ws2s

decl ::= pred var ( params* ) = formula;

formula ::= true
    | false
    | (formula)
    | ~formula
    | formula | formula
    | formula & formula
    | formula => formula
    | formula <=> formula
    | first-order-term
    | second-order-term
    | ex1 (var)+ : formula
    | ex2 (var)+ : formula
    | all1 (var)+ : formula
    | all2 (var)+ : formula

first-order-term ::= var = const

second-order-term ::= var = var
    | var ~= var
    | var sub var
    | sing var
    | eps var
    | var in var
    | var = var.0
    | var = var.1

const ::= root(.(0+1))*
```

Note that for experimental purposes it is possible to use full MONA syntax,
however, it requires local installation of MONA tool and enabling the option
*useMona* in *src/Main.hs*.

#### Example
```
pred allsub (var2 X) = all2 Y: X sub Y;
all2 X: ex1 x: (x in X | allsub(X));
```

### Install

For a successful run of the tool and all its features *python3*, *ghc* of
version 8.4 or greater, and *cabal* of version 2.2 or greater is needed. To compile
the tool carry out the following steps:

1. Install required Haskell and Python packages (below)
2. Run ``` $ make release ``` in the root folder

The tests can be run via ``` $ make test ``` .


#### Haskell Package Dependencies

* mtl
* time
* parsec
* temporary
* process
* bimap
* split
* strict-io
* network

You can install the packages via
```
$ cabal install <package>
```
or just
```
$ make install
```

#### Python Package Dependencies

Python scripts are used only for testing and automatized experimental
evaluation.

* termcolor

You can install the packages via
```
$ pip install <package>
```
